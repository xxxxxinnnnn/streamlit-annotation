• Assess Actionable Harm: Does the video describe or demonstrate a method that, if replicated, would violate established election laws regarding recording in polling places or voter privacy? If the method itself is illegal or clearly infringes on voter secrecy, this is a strong indicator for removal.

• Evaluate Intent vs. Impact: While the user claims to expose fraud, the method they propose (covert recording) directly contravenes voter privacy principles. My focus is on the impact of the action, not the user's stated intent.

• Review Platform Policies: Does the platform's ""election interference"" or ""voter privacy"" policy specifically address unauthorized recording or surveillance at polling places? A direct policy violation mandates a particular action (e.g., removal).

• Consider Legal Precedent/Guidance: Are there any local, national, or international laws or widely accepted election standards that prohibit covert recording in voting booths? The platform should align with respecting democratic processes.

Decision: Based on the high likelihood of violating voter privacy, potentially illegal activity, and disruption of election integrity, I would remove the post.

• Content Analysis:
  ◦ Ensure the post does not incite violence, hate, or illegal activity.
