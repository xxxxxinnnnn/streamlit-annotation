• Assess Intent & Imminence:
    ▪ Question: Does the post explicitly or implicitly advocate for violence as a means to achieve political change? Is there a direct call to action, and does the specified date suggest an immediate threat?
    ▪ Reasoning: All platforms prohibit credible threats of violence. Even if the language is couched, the combination of ""bring your firearms,"" ""force real change,"" and a specific date points to a call for armed confrontation. The imminence of the date amplifies the risk.

• Evaluate Context & Audience:
    ▪ Question: What is the historical context of similar rhetoric on this platform or in broader society? How is the post likely to be interpreted by a reasonable person, particularly within the intended audience?
    ▪ Reasoning: Understanding how such messages have been received or acted upon previously is crucial. A ""state capitol"" combined with calls for armed action has a recent history of violent real-world outcomes. A reasonable person would likely perceive this as a serious threat.

• Cross-Reference Platform Rules:
    ▪ Question: Does the post violate specific platform guidelines regarding incitement to violence, hate speech, dangerous organizations, or coordinated harm?
    ▪ Reasoning: Platform rules are the foundational legal and ethical framework. This post likely triggers rules against incitement to violence, especially if the platform has an explicit policy against calls for armed insurrection or overthrow.

• Consider Severity of Harm & Action:
    ▪ Question: What is the potential real-world harm if this post remains? Is removal, limiting spread, or a warning sufficient to mitigate that harm?
    ▪ Reasoning: Given the explicit call to bring firearms to a government building for ""real change,"" the potential for severe harm (injury, death, property damage, disruption of democratic processes) is extremely high. Therefore, the strongest action (removal) is warranted, potentially alongside reporting to law enforcement depending on legal obligations.

• Assess Intent vs. Impact: Does the influencer explicitly call for flagging to suspend the page, or is it merely encouragement to flag what they perceive as rule violations? If the intent is clearly to disable the page through coordinated flagging, it leans towards removal. If it's a general call to flag objectionable content, further evaluation is needed.

• Examine Coordinated Behavior: Is there evidence of a coordinated effort beyond the post itself (e.g., a sudden, documented surge in flagging activity, identical reports, or a clear ""call to action"" followed by immediate group compliance)? The act of flagging isn't inherently wrong, but coordinating it to silence a rival is. A single post alone might not be sufficient, but combined with rapid, orchestrated flagging, it strengthens the case for removal.

• Evaluate for Deception/Misinformation: Does the influencer encourage flagging based on false claims or misrepresentation of the rival's content? Coordinated flagging based on fabricated rule violations constitutes a form of political interference and harassment.

• Consider Free Speech vs. Platform Integrity: While free speech is paramount, platforms also have a right to maintain their integrity against manipulation. Is the post's primary purpose to engage in legitimate critique or to exploit platform mechanisms to silence an opponent? If it's the latter, platform integrity takes precedence.

Decision:

• Remove: If the post explicitly advocates for coordinated flagging to disable a rival's page, and/or there's clear evidence of such coordination spurred by the post, especially if based on deceptive claims. This directly violates rules against coordinated harassment and political interference.
• Warning/Demotion: If the intent is ambiguous but could reasonably lead to coordinated harassment, or if it encourages flagging for legitimate but exaggerated concerns, a warning or reduced visibility might be appropriate.
